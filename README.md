## About me

for Privacy. Plant-Based. Concerned about Environmental and Geopolitical Issues.
Based in County Wicklow, Ireland. The opinions expressed here are solely my own

I only use Github for operational reasons, like intervene or open ticket on some
repo here. I mostly use my forgejo private instance, and have some stuff
mirrored or hosted in codeberg:
